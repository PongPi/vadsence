# Usage 

1 - Clone the source 

2 - Install `yo`, `grunt-cli`, `bower`, and `generator-angular-fullstack`:
````bash
npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower generator-angular-fullstack
````

3 - Install deps and library
````bash
npm install && bower install 
````

4 - Run `grunt` for building, `grunt serve` for preview, and `grunt serve:dist` for a preview of the built app.

# Prerequisites

MongoDB - Download and Install MongoDB - If you plan on scaffolding your project with mongoose, you'll need mongoDB to be installed and have the `mongod` process running.

# Injection

A grunt task looks for new files in your `client/app` and `client/components` folder and automatically injects them in the appropriate places based on an injection block.

* `less` files into `client/app.less`
* `scss` files into `client/app.scss`
* `stylus` files into `client/app.styl`
* `css` files into `client/index.html`
* `js` files into `client/index.html`
* `coffeescript` temp `js` files into `client/index.html`
* `babel` temp `js` files into `client/index.html`

### Endpoint
Generates a new API endpoint.

Usage:
```bash
Usage:
  yo angular-fullstack:endpoint [options] <name>

Options:
  -h,   --help               # Print the generator's options and usage
        --skip-cache         # Do not remember prompt answers           Default: false
        --route              # URL for the endpoint
        --models             # Specify which model(s) to use
        --endpointDirectory  # Parent directory for enpoints

Arguments:
  name    Type: String  Required: true
```

Example:
```bash
yo angular-fullstack:endpoint message
[?] What will the url of your endpoint be? /api/messages
```

Produces:

    server/api/message/index.js
    server/api/message/message.spec.js
    server/api/message/message.controller.js
    server/api/message/message.model.js  (optional)
    server/api/message/message.socket.js (optional)

### Route
Generates a new route.

Example:
```bash
yo angular-fullstack:route myroute
[?] Where would you like to create this route? client/app/
[?] What will the url of your route be? /myroute
```

Produces:

    client/app/myroute/myroute.js
    client/app/myroute/myroute.controller.js
    client/app/myroute/myroute.controller.spec.js
    client/app/myroute/myroute.html
    client/app/myroute/myroute.scss


### Controller
Generates a controller.

Example:
```bash
yo angular-fullstack:controller user
[?] Where would you like to create this controller? client/app/
```

Produces:

    client/app/user/user.controller.js
    client/app/user/user.controller.spec.js

### Directive
Generates a directive.

Example:
```bash
yo angular-fullstack:directive myDirective
[?] Where would you like to create this directive? client/app/
[?] Does this directive need an external html file? Yes
```

Produces:

    client/app/myDirective/myDirective.directive.js
    client/app/myDirective/myDirective.directive.spec.js
    client/app/myDirective/myDirective.html
    client/app/myDirective/myDirective.scss

**Simple directive without an html file**

Example:
```bash
yo angular-fullstack:directive simple
[?] Where would you like to create this directive? client/app/
[?] Does this directive need an external html file? No
```

Produces:

    client/app/simple/simple.directive.js
    client/app/simple/simple.directive.spec.js

### Filter
Generates a filter.

Example:
```bash
yo angular-fullstack:filter myFilter
[?] Where would you like to create this filter? client/app/
```

Produces:

    client/app/myFilter/myFilter.filter.js
    client/app/myFilter/myFilter.filter.spec.js

### Service
Generates an AngularJS service.

Example:
```bash
yo angular-fullstack:service myService
[?] Where would you like to create this service? client/app/
```

Produces:

    client/app/myService/myService.service.js
    client/app/myService/myService.service.spec.js


You can also do `yo angular-fullstack:factory` and `yo angular-fullstack:provider` for other types of services.

### Decorator
Generates an AngularJS service decorator.

Example:
```bash
yo angular-fullstack:decorator serviceName
[?] Where would you like to create this decorator? client/app/
```

Produces

    client/app/serviceName/serviceName.decorator.js


## Configuration
Yeoman generated projects can be further tweaked according to your needs by modifying project files appropriately.

A `.yo-rc` file is generated for helping you copy configuration across projects, and to allow you to keep track of your settings. You can change this as you see fit.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the client and server unit tests with karma and mocha.

Use `grunt test:server` to only run server tests.

Use `grunt test:client` to only run client tests.

**Protractor tests**

To setup protractor e2e tests, you must first run

`npm run update-webdriver`

Use `grunt test:e2e` to have protractor go through tests located in the `e2e` folder.

**Code Coverage**

Use `grunt test:coverage` to run mocha-istanbul and generate code coverage reports.

`coverage/server` will be populated with `e2e` and `unit` folders containing the `lcov` reports.

The coverage taget has 3 available options:
- `test:coverage:unit` generate server unit test coverage
- `test:coverage:e2e` generate server e2e test coverage
- `test:coverage:check` combine the coverage reports and check against predefined thresholds

* *when no option is given `test:coverage` runs all options in the above order*

## Environment Variables

Keeping your app secrets and other sensitive information in source control isn't a good idea. To have grunt launch your app with specific environment variables, add them to the git ignored environment config file: `server/config/local.env.js`.
